# Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain
Developed a hospitality domain dashboard, centering on pivotal metrics crucial for the decision-making process within the industry. This dashboard promises to offer valuable insights for making informed choices in the realm of hospitality.

Tasks Completed:
- Established Key Metrics: Developed a comprehensive set of metrics, ensuring that all crucial aspects were covered for thorough analysis.
- Crafted a Dashboard: Designed and implemented a dynamic dashboard. Adding meticulous attention to detail to ensure seamless functionality and a user-friendly interface.

Things learned while working on this dashboard:
- Learned to build a new visual (calendar visual) using matrix table, which can be utilized for different purpose of analysis.
- After analyzing various cancellation policies implemented by different hotels, it became evident that the majority do not impose any fees if the booking is cancelled within three months of the reservation date. However, 
  if the cancellation occurs after this period, charges typically range from 60% to 90% of the total booking cost.
- Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.
